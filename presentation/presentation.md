# .net Core

*	started with ASP.net vNext on ASP.net team		
	2014-Q1		
*	influenced by
	*	node
	*	Ruby
	*	Go
	
## Motivation
	
	PACKAGE_MANAGER=apt-get
	#PACKAGE_MANAGER=yum
	
	#where mylang is some language/runtime
	$PACKAGE_MANAGER install mylang 
	
	#write or generate a foo.fb hello world program
	
	#compiles and runs foo
	mylang foo 
	
## Motivation 2	

*	installation
	*	via
		*	installers
		*	package managers
		*	bootstrappers
	*	easy to get and install
	*	lightweight
*	usage
	*	scaffolding
		dotnet new
*	*	building
		dotnet build
	*	running
		dotnet run
		
## Motivation 3

retain and extend .net features

*	safety (managed code, reliable)
*	scalable
*	performance (fast, native speed)
	*	exe becoomes  a native executable on a platform 
	*	doesn't require any external dependencies. 
	*	no .NET
	*	runs and it runs fast.

dotnet compile --native" you run it through the .NET Native chain and a larger EXE pops out. But that EXE is singular and native and just runs.

ASP.NET 4.6 is the more mature platform. It's battle-tested and released and available today. ASP.NET Core 1.0 is a 1.0 release that includes Web API and MVC but doesn't yet have SignalR or Web Pages. It doesn't yet support VB or F#. It will have these subsystems some day but not today.

We don't want anyone to think that ASP.NET Core 1.0 is the finish line. It's a new beginning and a fork in the road, but ASP.NET 4.6 continues on, released and fully supported. There's lots of great stuff coming, stay tuned!
